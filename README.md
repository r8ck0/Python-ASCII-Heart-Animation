Python ASCII Heart Animation
A fun Python script that displays a pulsing ASCII heart animation with a "I ❤️ Python!" message. Perfect for beginners or as a creative coding project.
Features

Text-based heart animation using ASCII art.
Pulsing effect with a clear screen mechanism.
Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).

Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed (Download Python).
A terminal or command-line interface (e.g., Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).

Installation

Clone or download this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-ascii-heart.git

Or download the ZIP file and extract it.

Navigate to the project directory:
cd python-ascii-heart


Ensure Python is installed:
python --version

If not installed, download and install Python from python.org. Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.


Usage
Running on Windows 10

Open Command Prompt (Win + R, type cmd, press Enter`).
Navigate to the project directory:cd path\to\python-ascii-heart


Run the script:python heart.py


The ASCII heart will pulse, followed by the final heart and "I ❤️ Python!" message.

Running on macOS/Linux

Open Terminal.
Navigate to the project directory:cd path/to/python-ascii-heart


Run the script:python3 heart.py

Notes

The script uses os.system('cls') on Windows and os.system('clear') on macOS/Linux for screen clearing. Ensure your terminal supports these commands.
No external dependencies are required.

Code
The main script (heart.py) is included in the repository. It uses Python's time and os modules to create the animation.
